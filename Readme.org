#+title: Math Utils
Generic math utils used in assorted [[https://projecteuler.net][Project Euler]] excercises.

Attempts to give some utilities to ease development and be fast, if possible.

Utilities get worked on and added as they become necessary to me solving
problems, so there is no particular order or schedule.
